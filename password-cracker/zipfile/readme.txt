Itâ€™s a password cracker for zip-files or rar-files, through dictionary attack.

First, you need to find a dictionary for the passwords.

Here, I recommend this source where you may find some useful dictionaries.

Second, make the zip file, the dictionary and the zipcracker.py in the same file.

Third, open the terminal, move to that file, and run
            
       pyhton zipcracker.py -f file -d dictionary

It is just a quite easy code, and the effects depends more on dictionary.

By the way, this code is just for fun.
