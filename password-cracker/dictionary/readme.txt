This is a dictionary generator for brute-force attack.

Since brute-force attack may take ages to succeed,why not try out a dictionary attack first?

Base on the predictions of password, we can generate our own dictionary to perform dictionary attack.

Still, if we only know few things about the password, the size of this dictionary will still be very large, since this program will generate all possible combination of the elements we choose.

This generator will be useful when we know exact the length and the composition of the password.
